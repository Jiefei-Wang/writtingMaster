This is a sample text file that we can use to test our proofreading software. It contains several instances of isolated pronouns that our module should identify.

This sentence starts with an isolated pronoun. That sentence also starts with one. These sentences are examples. Those examples are useful for testing.

In the middle of a sentence, we might find this kind of construction. Or that kind of pattern. These kinds of examples are helpful. Those types of sentences work too.

Some pronouns should not be matched, like "this" when it's part of a larger word like "thisexample" or "anotherthis". Similarly, "that" in "thatexample" should not be matched.

But standalone pronouns like this one should be identified. That one too. These are clear cases. Those are also obvious.

This.
That.
These.
Those.

The end of the text.
