Analyze the following two consecutive sentences and determine if they must need a transition word between them.

Previous context (for reference only, if empty, it is the beginning of the paragraph):
{previous_context}

Sentence 1: "{sentence1}"
Sentence 2: "{sentence2}"


Response Format:
Respond ONLY with a JSON object in this exact format (do NOT output CSV or any other format):
{
  "transition": 0 or 1,
  "candidates": "candidate1, candidate2, candidate3" or ""
}


Instructions:
1. Determine if there needs a transition word between sentence1 and sentence2. Be conservative, only use transition word when you feel it looks awkward otherwise.
2. If a transition word is needed but there isn't, suggest appropriate candidates based on the relationship between the sentences
3. If there is already a proper transition word, respond with transition: 0
