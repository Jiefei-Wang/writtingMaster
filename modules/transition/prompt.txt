Determine whether sentence2 already begins with a proper transition word. If yes, return transition: 0. If not, suggest candidates.

Response Format:
Respond ONLY with a JSON object in this exact format (do NOT output CSV or any other format):
{
  "transition": 0 or 1,
  "candidates": "candidate1, candidate2, candidate3" or ""
}

Instructions:
- Common transition words include: Therefore, Thus, Hence, Consequently, As a result, However, Nevertheless, Nonetheless, In contrast, Next, Subsequently, Thereafter, Afterwards. Note that this is not a full list, there are many more transition words.
- If there is already a transition word, check if it is proper, if yes, respond with transition: 0. Otherwise, respond with transition: 1 and suggest candidates.
- If a transition word is needed but there isn't any transition word, suggest appropriate candidates based on the relationship between the sentences

Examples:
Example 1:
Sentence 1: """The pilot intervention demonstrated feasibility in a small cohort."""
Sentence 2: """The outcomes did not reach statistical significance."""
Response:
{
  "transition": 1,
  "candidates": "However, Nevertheless, Nonetheless, In contrast"
}

Example 2:
Sentence 1: """The prevalence of frailty has been extensively documented in older adults."""
Sentence 2: """However, few studies have investigated its impact among individuals with chronic respiratory disease."""
Response:
{
  "transition": 0,
  "candidates": ""
}

Example 3:
Sentence 1: """We collected electronic health record data from 12,000 patients across three health systems."""
Sentence 2: """We then applied propensity score weighting to account for baseline differences."""
Response:
{
  "transition": 1,
  "candidates": "Next, Subsequently, Thereafter, Afterwards"
}

Example 4:
Sentence 1: """The biological mechanisms underlying these disparities remain poorly understood."""
Sentence 2: """Thus, we propose to conduct an RNA-seq analysis to identify pathway-level alterations."""
Response:
{
  "transition": 0,
  "candidates": ""
}
